It supports a number of key Web3j project features including the creation of: Ethereum applications in Java or Kotlin OpenAPI services for Ethereum smart contracts These projects can then be run by the Web3j CLI either natively as an application binary or within a Docker container. Behind the scenes there are some more granular commands that you can also use, including: Wallet creation Wallet password management Ether transfer from one wallet to another Generation of Solidity smart contract wrappers Generation of unit tests for Java smart contract wrappers Smart contract auditing Account creation & management Installation \u00b6 The simplest way to install the Web3j CLI is via the following script: curl -L get.web3j.io | sh && source ~/.web3j/source.sh You can verify the installation was successful by running web3j -V , which should output as follows: $ web3j -v __ __ _ ____ _ \\ \\ / / | | | ___ \\( _ ) \\ \\ / \\ / /__ | | __ __ ) | _ \\ \\/ \\/ / _ \\ ' _ \\| __ < | | \\ / \\ / __/ | _ ) | __ ) | | \\/ \\/ \\_ __ | _.__/____/ | | _/ | | __/ BY WEB3LABS Version: 1 .4.0 Alternatively you can download the latest CLI release here . Project creation \u00b6 The web3j new and web3j import commands provide a convenient way to create a new Java or Kotlin project, or OpenAPI service using Web3j's Command Line Tools. For Java or Kotlin projects, they provide the following functionality: Base project creation. Generation of a simple Hello World Solidity contract or import an existing Solidity project from a file or directory. Generation of ERC20 and ERC777 Java projects using : web3j new erc20 | erc777 Compilation of the Solidity files. Configure the project to use the Gradle build tool. Generate Java smart contract wrappers for all provided Solidity files. Add the required Web3j dependencies, to run and interact with the contracts. Generate unit tests for the Java smart contract wrappers. In the case of an OpenAPI service, with the command web3j openapi new , Web3j creates a runnable OpenAPI service for deploying and interacting with smart contracts via OpenAPI compliant endpoints with full Swagger documentation provided. Web3j also gives you the ability to do more via: Base OpenAPI project creation : web3j openapi new . ERC20 and ERC777 OpenAPI project creation : web3j openapi new erc20 | erc777 Create an OpenAPI project using specific contracts : web3j openapi import . Generate an OpenAPI executable JAR : web3j openapi jar . Generate RESTful endpoints and their implementation : web3j openapi generate . Create a new project \u00b6 To generate a new project : web3j new [ --kotlin | -o <output path> | -n <project name> | -p <package name> ] [ helloworld | erc20 | erc777 ] Where supported new command arguments are as follows: --kotlin Creation of a new Kotlin project instead of the default Java one helloworld Use a simple Hello World Solidity smart contract (default) erc777 Create an ERC777 compliant token erc20 Create an ERC20 compliant token The ERC20 and ERC777 contracts are based on the OpenZeppelin implementations. The project name and package name values must comply with the JVM standards. The project name is also used as the main class name. If no arguments are specified, the default project creation used is: web3j new helloworld Details of the created project structure are below . Import an existing project \u00b6 Similarly, to web3j new , web3j import will create a new project but with user defined smart contracts. By default a Java project will be generated if no option is provided. web3j import -s <path to solidity sources> [ -o <path> | -n <project name> | -p <package name> ] -t The -s option will work with a single Solidity file or a folder containing Solidity files. The -t option is true by default. By passing -t unit tests will be generated for the Java wrappers. or web3j import Then, you will be prompted to set the Solidity files directory: You will be prompted to answer a series of questions to create your project: ``` shell __ __ _ ____ _ \\ \\ / / | | |___ \\(_) \\ \\ /\\ / /__| |__ __) |_ \\ \\/ \\/ / _ \\ '_ \\|__ <| | \\ /\\ / __/ |_) |__) | | \\/ \\/ \\___|_.__/____/| | _/ | |__/ BY WEB3LABS Please enter the path to your solidity file/folder [Required Field]: /path/to/solidity ... Running your application \u00b6 The web3j run <network> command can be used to run your application on a specify an Ethereum network. Web3j will need the node endpoint the wallet path and the wallet password. To take advantage of this, you simply need to run the following command in your project directory: web3j run If you created an OpenAPI service, by default it binds to port 9090 on your host. You can access the SwaggerUI for the service via the URL http://localhost:9090/swagger-ui . However, if you'd like your application to be bundled up as a container instead, simply run: web3j docker run [-l] <network> <wallet_path> <wallet_password> This will build a container containing your application. Environment variables \u00b6 A number of properties can be configured for your Web3j applications to customise them at runtime. The following configuration properties can be used for Java or OpenAPI projects: WEB3J_ENDPOINT Ethereum node URL WEB3J_WALLET_PATH Path to Ethereum wallet WEB3J_WALLET_PASSWORD Ethereum wallet password WEB3J_PRIVATE_KEY Hex-encoded private key string (0x...) Additionally, for OpenAPI services, the following properties can be used: WEB3J_OPENAPI_NAME Project name WEB3J_OPENAPI_CONTRACT_ADDRESSES Pre-deployed contract addresses as a map (Contract1=0x...,Contract2=0x...) WEB3J_OPENAPI_HOST Hostname for service, defaults to localhost WEB3J_OPENAPI_PORT Port to bind to, defaults to 9090 Running with the Java Runtimie Environment (JRE) \u00b6 These properties can be used as environment variables if running project using the Java JRE: export VAR1 = value ... java -jar <app>.jar You can find the relevent application binary in the following locations: Java or Kotlin projects: build/libs/<project-name>-0.1.0-all.jar OpenAPI projects build/libs/<projectName>-server-all.jar Or, for OpenAPI, you can generate an executable JAR directly using: ```shell script $ web3j openapi jar ### Running with Docker If running the built container with Docker, you should use the following syntax to pass in environment variables: ``` shell docker run -e VAR1=value1 -e VAR2=value2 web3app Running with Gradle \u00b6 If you wish to use the Gradle build tool to run your application, you should pass in the required variables in using the following syntax, where variable names are in lowercase and understcores are replaced with hyphens in their names. ./gradlew run --args = \"--<var1> <value1> --<var2> <value2> ...\" Generated Java/Kotlin project structure \u00b6 Your application code and tests will be located in the following project directories: For Java: ./src/main/java - Generated Java application code stub ./src/test/java - Generated Java test code stubs ./src/main/solidity - Solidity source code For Kotlin: ./src/main/kotlin - Generated Kotlin application code stub ./src/test/kotlin - Generated Kotlin test code stubs ./src/main/solidity - Solidity source code If you need to edit the build file, it is located in the project root directory: ./build.gradle - Gradle build configuration file Additionally, there are the following Gradle artifacts which you can ignore. /gradle - local Gradle installation /.gradle - local Gradle cache /build - compiled classes including smart contract bindings If you need to view any of the generated Solidity or contract artifacts, they are available in the following locations. Solidity bin and abi files are located at: ./build/resources/main/solidity/ The source code for the generated smart contract bindings can be found at: ./build/generated/sources/web3j/main/java/<your-package>/generated/contracts The compiled code for the generated smart contracts bindings is available at the below location. These are the artifacts used to deploy, transact and query your smart contracts. ./build/classes/java/main/<your-package>/generated/contracts/ Generated OpenAPI project structure \u00b6 Similar to the Java/Kotlin projects. The Solidity files are located in the following ./src/main/solidity . Additionally, the generated OpenAPI code resides in ./build/generated/sources/web3j/main , and is structured as follows : Java smart contract wrappers : java/<package name>/wrappers REST endpoints interfaces : kotlin/<package name>/core REST endpoints implementations : kotlin/<package name>/server SwaggerUI : resources/static/swagger-ui Build commands \u00b6 Web3j projects use the Gradle build tool under the covers. Gradle is a build DSL for JVM projects used widely in Java, Kotlin and Android projects. You shouldn't need to be too concerned with the semantics of Gradle beyond the following build commands: To build the project run: ./gradlew build To update just the smart contract bindings following changes to the Solidity code run: ./gradlew generateContractWrappers To update the OpenAPI code, when using an OpenAPI project, following changes to the Solidity code run: ./gradlew generateWeb3jOpenApi To update the generated SwaggerUI, when using an OpenAPI project, following changes to the Solidity code run: ./gradlew generateWeb3jSwaggerUi To delete all project build artifacts, creating a clean environment, run: ./gradlew clean Stand-alone unit test generation \u00b6 When creating a new project or importing solidity contracts, by using: web3j generate tests You will be prompted to answer a series of questions to generate your tests: __ __ _ ____ _ \\ \\ / / | | | ___ \\( _ ) \\ \\ / \\ / /__ | | __ __ ) | _ \\ \\/ \\/ / _ \\ ' _ \\| __ < | | \\ / \\ / __/ | _ ) | __ ) | | \\/ \\/ \\_ __ | _.__/____/ | | _/ | | __/ BY WEB3LABS Please enter the path of the generated contract wrappers. < source contract wrappers> Where would you like to save your tests. <path to tests> Unit tests were generated successfully at location: . The command can also be used non-interactively web3j generate tests -i <Solidity Java wrappers> -o <output path> When adding the path to your Java wrappers make sure you specify the path up to the package root e.g: If a class with name HelloWorld and package name org.com.web3j is located under /home/user/code/myproject/org/com/web3j/HelloWorld.java , the correct way to point to that class is /home/user/code/myproject/ Wallet tools \u00b6 To generate a new Ethereum wallet: $ web3j wallet create To update the password for an existing wallet: $ web3j wallet update <walletfile> To send Ether to another address: $ web3j wallet send <walletfile> 0x<address> | <ensName> When sending Ether to another address you will be asked a series of questions before the transaction takes place. Check below for a full example. The following example demonstrates using Web3j to send Ether to another wallet. With the following input: web3j wallet send <walletfile> 0x<address> | <ensName> Web3j proceeds as follows: __ __ _ ____ _ \\ \\ / / | | | ___ \\( _ ) \\ \\ / \\ / /__ | | __ __ ) | _ \\ \\/ \\/ / _ \\ '_ \\|__ <| | \\ /\\ / __/ |_) |__) | | \\/ \\/ \\___|_.__/____/| | _/ | |__/ BY WEB3LABS Please enter your existing wallet file password: Wallet for address 0x19e03255f667bdfd50a32722df860b1eeaf4d635 loaded Please confirm address of running Ethereum client you wish to send the transfer request to [http://localhost:8545/]: Connected successfully to client: Geth/v1.4.18-stable-c72f5459/darwin/go1.7.3 What amound would you like to transfer (please enter a numeric value): 0.000001 Please specify the unit (ether, wei, ...)

These are not always obvious to programmers. Issues can include integer precision problems , re-entrancy attacks , and many other flaws. As Ethereum smart contracts are immutable once they have been deployed, it is important that they are bug-free at this point. Web3j is able to audit smart contracts for certain common issues and vulnerabilities using static code analysis. To audit a smart contract (in this instance, Campaign.sol): $ web3j audit Campaign.sol An example of the output from this command is as follows: __ __ _ ____ _ \\ \\ / / | | | ___ \\( _ ) \\ \\ / \\ / /__ | | __ __ ) | _ \\ \\/ \\/ / _ \\ ' _ \\| __ < | | \\ / \\ / __/ | _ ) | __ ) | | \\/ \\/ \\_ __ | _.__/____/ | | _/ | | __/ BY WEB3LABS ./Campaign.sol 131 :58 severity:2 Multiplication after division SOLIDITY_DIV_MUL_09hhh1 91 :8 severity:1 Revert inside the if -operator SOLIDITY_REVERT_REQUIRE_c56b12 5 :4 severity:1 Use of SafeMath SOLIDITY_SAFEMATH_837cac 148 :4 severity:1 Replace multiple return values with a struct SOLIDITY_SHOULD_RETURN_STRUCT_83hf3l 125 :4 severity:1 Prefer external to public visibility level SOLIDITY_UNUSED_FUNCTION_SHOULD_BE_EXTERNAL_73ufc1 \u2716 5 problems ( 5 errors ) The output is in the form of a list of issues/errors detected by the static analysis tool.

To audit a smart contract (in this instance, Campaign.sol): $ web3j audit Campaign.sol An example of the output from this command is as follows: __ __ _ ____ _ \\ \\ / / | | | ___ \\( _ ) \\ \\ / \\ / /__ | | __ __ ) | _ \\ \\/ \\/ / _ \\ ' _ \\| __ < | | \\ / \\ / __/ | _ ) | __ ) | | \\/ \\/ \\_ __ | _.__/____/ | | _/ | | __/ BY WEB3LABS ./Campaign.sol 131 :58 severity:2 Multiplication after division SOLIDITY_DIV_MUL_09hhh1 91 :8 severity:1 Revert inside the if -operator SOLIDITY_REVERT_REQUIRE_c56b12 5 :4 severity:1 Use of SafeMath SOLIDITY_SAFEMATH_837cac 148 :4 severity:1 Replace multiple return values with a struct SOLIDITY_SHOULD_RETURN_STRUCT_83hf3l 125 :4 severity:1 Prefer external to public visibility level SOLIDITY_UNUSED_FUNCTION_SHOULD_BE_EXTERNAL_73ufc1 \u2716 5 problems ( 5 errors ) The output is in the form of a list of issues/errors detected by the static analysis tool. The first column of output shows the line and the character at which the issue was encountered. The second column shows the severity; this ranges from 1 to 3, with 3 being the most severe. The next column contains a description of the issue found, and the final column provides a reference to the rule used to find the issue.

As a Web3j library we've kept everything as simple as possible for users to get them on their way quickly. In this chapter we'll guide you through the few steps required to get your application interacting with any Eth2 Beacon Chain Node. Getting started \u00b6 First, you\u2019ll need to add the library to your project, either using Maven: <dependency> <groupId> org.web3j.eth2 </groupId> <artifactId> beacon-node-api </artifactId> <version> 1.0.0 </version> </dependency> or Gradle: implementation 'org.web3j.eth2:beacon-node-api:1.0.0' At the moment of writing this, the first released version 1.0.0 corresponds to the Eth2 specification v0.12.2. Check the project releases page for the last available version. Once you have added the library to your project, you can create a client instance pointing to a particular Beacon Chain node in a familiar Web3j-esque way: var service = new BeaconNodeService ( \"http://...\" ); var client = BeaconNodeClientFactory . build ( service ); That\u2019s it! At this point, you can start calling the node endpoints, for instance to retrieve the head block: client . getBeacon (). getBlocks (). findById ( NamedBlockId . HEAD ); Or to retrieve all current attester slashings: client . getBeacon (). getPool () . getAttesterSlashings () . findAll (); If you don\u2019t know a Beacon Chain node where you can point your client code, in the next section we'll guide you through a few simple steps to get a test network up and running. Start a test network \u00b6 In this section we\u2019ll be using the Teku Beacon Chain implementation to start a local test network where to point your client code (before this, make sure you are running a Docker environment). First, clone the Teku project in a local folder: $ git clone https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku.git Then start the Beacon Chain local network (check the Teku docs for more information on the Docker Testnet): $ teku/test-network/launch.sh Recreating test-network_teku1_1 ... done Starting test-network_prometheus_1 ... done Starting test-network_node-exporter_1 ... done Recreating test-network_teku4_1 ... done Recreating test-network_teku2_1 ... done Recreating test-network_teku3_1 ... done Starting test-network_grafana_1 ... done You\u2019ll get a bunch of logs, but once your network has completely started you\u2019ll be able to point to any of the four nodes at ports 19601 , 19602 , 19603 and 19604 .

As everything is local and in-process, there is no need to start up external Ethereum nodes, which helps with easy of use and performance. Everything runs within the JVM process, including EVM bytecode, which allows for easy debugging of Solidity smart contracts. Getting started \u00b6 Often you'd use this together with the web3j-unit project, allowing you to run unit and integration tests without the need to start an Ethereum node. If you want to use this within our own project directly, you would need the EVM dependency + a few external libraries. Have a look at the example project on how to do this. repositories { mavenCentral () jcenter () } dependencies { implementation \"org.web3j:core:4.8.7\" implementation \"org.web3j:web3j-evm:4.8.7\" } Below is a simple demonstration of ETH transactions, contract deployment and simple contract interactions.

The demo also show to how get started with the EmbeddedWeb3jService which is what you'd use when building your web3j instance. This demo is available on the example project . Debugging smart contracts and transactions \u00b6 While running locally with the embedded EVM it is possible to debug the internal state when deploying and invoking functions on a contract. You do this by giving the embedded Web3j service what's called an operation tracer. We have developed one which allows for console-based debugging sessions and code walkthroughs called ConsoleDebugTracer . To enable this simply pass an instance of this in as a second parameter on the EmbeddedWeb3jService constructor. OperationTracer operationTracer = new ConsoleDebugTracer (); Web3j web3j = Web3j . build ( new EmbeddedWeb3jService ( configuration , operationTracer )); When your project leverages our gradle plugin the ConsoleDebugTracer will automatically pick up Solidity contract metadata and use that to display source code context. Usually, these meta data json files are stored within build/resources/main/solidity . If you have chosen to place these elsewhere you will need to specify their location when creating the debugger instance: OperationTracer operationTracer = new ConsoleDebugTracer ( new File ( \"alternative/metadata/file/location\" )); Options while debugging \u00b6 The ConsoleDebugTracer allows you to interact with the debugging session using your terminal. Several options are available as shown below. You can also see these in the terminal by using the help option. Command line option Description [enter] Continue running until next code section. [number] Step forward X number of opcodes. next Run until the next breakpoint. end Run until the end of current transaction. abort Terminate the function call. show|hide opcodes Show or hide opcodes. show|hide stack Show or hide the stack. break [file name] [line number] Add or remove a breakpoint. break list Show all breakpoint. break clear Remove all breakpoint. For example, assume I'm debugging a Solidity contract with its source code stored in a file called Greeter.sol. If I want to have the debugger stop at a specific line in that file I'd add a breakpoint with the break option: break Greeter.sol 13 . Hitting enter after adding that breakpoint will make the debugger progress until it reaches line 13 in Greeter.sol. Likewise, if I only want to see the Solidity source code and don't care to see opcodes and the stack, I'd execute the hide opcodes and hide stack commands. Embedded Ethereum \u00b6 Usually when interacting with Ethereum you do so by connecting to an Ethereum node. This node can either be hosted externally, or it might be one you've started locally. In either case, you need to connect to another process to make transactions, deploy contracts or interact with these contracts. This brings with it a few drawbacks: You need to manage this external dependency, either through connection configuration or through a separate local application Communication between your JVM, which runs your Web3j integrations, and this external Ethereum process breaks the flow and adds lag While sometimes you do want this external dependency, for example when you are doing transactions on Ethereum mainnet or a testnet, it is often unwanted while doing local development. The Web3j EVM library solves this by providing an embedded EVM and associated ledger. This EVM runs within the same JVM as your code, freeing you from needing to make external connections. No other processes are needed as the EVM and the ledger are themselves coded in Java, and the Web3j EVM is simply used as a library within your code. If you want to use this feature within your unit and integration tests, we would recommend you explore the Web3j unit library as that provides a more complete testing experience. How to run Web3j with embedded EVM \u00b6 As shown on the EVM example project , using the embedded EVM is as easy as adding required dependencies and then use the EmbeddedWeb3jService . repositories { mavenCentral () jcenter () } dependencies { implementation \"org.web3j:core:$web3jVersion\" implementation \"org.web3j:web3j-evm:$web3jVersion\" } Web3j web3j = Web3j . build ( new EmbeddedWeb3jService ( configuration )); The configuration given to the embedded Web3j service includes the address you want to make your own and also how much test Ether you want to pre-fund on this account. Assuming you have a Web3j wallet already, you can create this configuration object as shown next: Credentials credentials = WalletUtils . loadCredentials ( \"Wallet password\" , \"wallet.json\" ); Configuration configuration = new Configuration ( new Address ( credentials . getAddress ()), 10 ); With this configured you can now use your Web3j instance as normal.","title":"Web3j EVM"},{"location":"web3j_evm/#web3j-evm","text":"Web3j-evm is an embedded freestanding Ethereum EVM and ledger running within a Java process, which can be used for unit and integration testing your Web3j projects.

Based on example at https://www.ethereum.org/greeter. contract Mortal { /* Define variable owner of the type address*/ address owner; /* this function is executed at initialization and sets the owner of the contract */ constructor () {owner = msg.sender;} modifier onlyOwner { require( msg.sender == owner, \"Only owner can call this function.\" ); _; } /* Function to recover the funds on the contract */ function kill() onlyOwner public {selfdestruct(msg.sender);} } contract HelloWorld is Mortal { /* define variable greeting of the type string */ string greet; /* this runs when the contract is executed */ constructor (string memory _greet) { greet = _greet; } function newGreeting(string memory _greet) onlyOwner public { emit Modified(greet, _greet, greet, _greet); greet = _greet; } /* main function */ function greeting() public view returns (string memory) { return greet; } event Modified( string indexed oldGreetingIdx, string indexed newGreetingIdx, string oldGreeting, string newGreeting); } generates the following OpenAPI specs : { \"openapi\":\"3.0.1\", \"info\":{ \"title\":\"Web3j OpenApi\", \"contact\":{ \"name\":\"Web3 Labs\", \"url\":\"http://web3labs.com\", \"email\":\"hi@web3labs.com\" }, \"version\":\"4.8.7\" }, \"tags\":[ { \"name\":\"default\", \"description\":\"Lists existing contracts and events\" }, { \"name\":\"HelloWorld Methods\", \"description\":\"List HelloWorld method&#39;s calls\" }, { \"name\":\"HelloWorld Events\", \"description\":\"List HelloWorld event&#39;s calls\" } ], \"paths\":{ \"/Web3App/contracts/helloworld/{contractAddress}/Kill\":{ \"get\":{ \"tags\":[ \"HelloWorld Methods\" ], \"summary\":\"Execute the Kill method\", \"operationId\":\"kill\", \"parameters\":[ { \"name\":\"contractAddress\", \"in\":\"path\", \"required\":true, \"schema\":{ \"type\":\"string\" } } ], \"responses\":{ \"default\":{ \"description\":\"default response\", \"content\":{ \"application/json\":{ \"schema\":{ \"$ref\":\"#/components/schemas/TransactionReceiptModel\" } } } } } } }, ... With a corresponding Swagger-UI : The available methods are: The available events are: Getting started with Web3j-OpenAPI \u00b6 Generate a project \u00b6 To generate an OpenAPI project using the Web3j-OpenAPI generator, you need to have the Web3j-CLI installed on your machine. It\u2019s easy to do (for Windows instructions head here ): $ curl -L get.web3j.io | sh Then, you can run the $ web3j openapi import --help To check the generator available options. In this case, we will be using the above Hello World contract. Put that contract in a file named HelloWorld.sol for starters. Then, execute the following command: $ web3j openapi import \\ -s=HelloWorld.sol \\ --package=com.tutorial \\ --project-name=HelloWorldProject \\ --output-dir=. You should be seeing logs similar to the following: Configure the project \u00b6 You can run the project easily, without specify any configuration, using the Web3j-cli . If not, you need to specify runtime parameters. for example, the private key or wallet file for the signing, the node endpoint to connect to, etc. To see the available options, run the distributions executable or the JAR with the --help flag. You'll get the following display: To specify these parameters, you can set the following environment variables: $ export WEB3J_ENDPOINT=<link_to_your_Ethereum_node> $ export WEB3J_PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key> $ export WEB3J_OPENAPI_HOST=localhost $ export WEB3J_OPENAPI_PORT=9090 For more ways to pass these parameters, check the configuration section below. Run the project \u00b6 We can run the project directly : $ ./gradlew run You should be able to run the server and see the following: Interact with the generated project \u00b6 Interactions can be done in multiple ways : SwaggerUI \u00b6 The generated SwaggerUI is located on {host}:{port}/swagger-ui and can be used to do all possible interactions with the API. eg: HTTP requests \u00b6 Sending HTTP requests via tools like Curl : $ curl -X POST \"http://{host}:{port}/HelloWorldProject/contracts/helloworld/{contract address}/NewGreeting\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"_greet\\\":\\\"Hello Web3j-OpenAPI\\\"}\" Client application \u00b6 It is also possible to interact using a Java/Kotlin client application. This latter can be done using our client implementation. Make sure to add the client dependency to your project. dependencies { implementation \"org.web3j.openapi:web3j-openapi-client:4.8.7\" } Then, you will be able to interact with the API as follows: val service = ClientService(\"http://localhost:9090\") val helloWorldProject = ClientFactory.create(HelloWorldProjectApi::class.java, service) println(\"Deploying the HelloWorld contract...\") val receipt = helloWorldProject.contracts.helloWorld.deploy(HelloWorldDeployParameters(\"Hello\")) println(\"Deployed contract address: ${receipt.contractAddress}\") val newGreetingHash = helloWorldProject.contracts .helloWorld .load(receipt.contractAddress) .newGreeting(NewGreetingParameters(\"Hello Web3j-OpenAPI\")) .transactionHash println(\"NewGreeting method execution transaction hash: $newGreetingHash\") val greeting = helloWorldProject.contracts .helloWorld .load(receipt.contractAddress) .greeting() .result println(\"Greeting method result: $greeting\") Ways to generate an OpenAPI project \u00b6 First, you need to install the Web3j-CLI on your machine. It\u2019s easy to do (for Windows instructions head here ): $ curl -L get.web3j.io | sh Generate a Hello World project \u00b6 A Hello World project is a simple project based on a simple Solidity contract. It is generated using: $ web3j openapi new This project can be used as a minimal project to start building your custom application upon. Generate using custom Solidity smart contracts \u00b6 To generate a project using your desired smart contracts, use the following command: $ web3j openapi import \\ --solidity-path <path_to_Solidity_contracts> \\ --project-name <project name> \\ --package <package name> Generate an executable JAR \u00b6 The following command will generate an executable JAR ready to be run: $ web3j openapi jar \\ --solidity-path <path_to_Solidity_contracts> Generate the REST API only \u00b6 To generate only the API, ie the defined endpoints with their implementations, use the following: $ web3j openapi generate \\ --solidity-path <path_to_Solidity_contracts> \\ --with-implementations=true This command will not generate a whole project structure. Thus, you will not have a runnable application. To have one, check the above sections. The with-implementations flag is set to true by default. This means that the RESTful endpoints will be generated along their implementations. If you prefer to generate only the interfaces. Set that flag to false : --with-implementations=false Generate using the web3j-openapi-gradle-plugin \u00b6 It is possible to generate a Web3j-OpenAPI project directly from your gradle project using the web3j-openapi-gradle-plugin . Check the documentation for more information. Run the project \u00b6 Runtime parameters \u00b6 Before running the server, there are some parameters that need to be set. There are multiple ways of doing so: Environment variables Configuration file Passing the parameters directly to the JAR or the executable. Also, you can run the project without worrying about any of this using the Web3j-cli Supported parameters \u00b6 Name Default value Description name Generation project name The project name config file ~/.web3j/web3j.openapi.<extension> A custom configuration file to import extra parameters endpoint none Ethereum node endpoint to target when interacting with the blockchain private key none User private key in hex format prefixed by 0x wallet path none The path to the wallet file (can be absolute or relative) wallet password none The password of the specified wallet file in plain text host localhost The server host (can be an IP address or a hostname) port 8080 The server port contract addresses none Use pre-deployed contract addresses: contract1=0x123,contract2=0x1234 . All you need to provide to the generator is the ABIs. The necessary parameters are: The Ethereum node endpoint to target when interacting with the Ethereum network endpoint Credentials : which can be either private key , or wallet path and wallet password The remaining parameters are optional. Order of precedence \u00b6 The parameters can be specified interchangeably between different sources. ie, you can have some defined in a default configuration file and others in environment variables etc. However, for duplicated values, we enforce the following order : CLI arguments Custom configuration file specified in the CLI Custom configuration file specified in Environment variables Default configuration file Environment variables Check the following sections for more information. CLI arguments \u00b6 The CLI arguments can be passed to the command the usual way. Example \u00b6 Check the Starting the server section below to choose a command. $ <command> \\ --private-key 0x1234 \\ --name OpenApiProject \\ --endpoint <Ethereum node endpoint> \\ --host localhost \\ --port 9090 \\ --contract-addresses contract1=0x1234,contract2=0x123 Configuration file \u00b6 You can put the parameters in a configuration file . This latter, can be YAML , Json or Java properties type of files. The configuration file can be : Put in the default directory : ~/.web3j/web3j.openapi.<extension> Set in an environment variable: WEB3J_OPENAPI_CONFIG_FILE where the value is the path to the file. eg. export WEB3J_OPENAPI_CONFIG_FILE=<path_to_the_config_file} Set as an argument when running the JAR or the executable: --config-file The supported extensions are : yaml for a YAML configuration. Example: contractAddresses : helloworld : \"0x1234\" helloworld2 : \"0x1234\" credentials : privateKey : \"0x1234\" network : endpoint : \"<your_node_endpoint_address>\" project : name : \"OpenApiProject\" server : host : \"localhost\" port : 9090 json for a Json configuration. Example: { \"contractAddresses\" : { \"helloworld\" : \"0x1234\" , \"helloworld2\" : \"0x1234\" }, \"credentials\" : { \"privateKey\" : \"0x1234\" }, \"network\" : { \"endpoint\" : \"your node endpoint address\" }, \"project\" : { \"name\" : \"OpenApiProject\" }, \"server\" : { \"host\" : \"localhost\" , \"port\" : 9090 } } properties for a Java properties configuration. Example: contractAddresses=helloworld=0x1234,helloworld2=0x1234 credentials.privateKey=0x1234 network.endpoint=your node endpoint address project.name=OpenApiProject server.host=localhost server.port=9090 Environment variables \u00b6 The easiest way to provide the runtime parameters is through environment variables. The rule is to: Replace the - with a _ : private-key => private_key Upper case the options' names : private-key => PRIVATE_KEY Example \u00b6 $ export WEB3J_ENDPOINT=<link_to_your_Ethereum_node> $ export WEB3J_OPENAPI_HOST=localhost $ export WEB3J_OPENAPI_PORT=9090 $ export WEB3J_OPENAPI_NAME=Web3jOpenAPI $ export WEB3J_OPENAPI_CONTRACT_ADDRESSES=helloworld=0x1234,helloworld2=0x12345 $ export WEB3J_OEPNAPI_CONFIG_FILE=~/myConfig.yaml And one of the following: A raw private key : $ export WEB3J_PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234 A wallet : $ export WEB3J_WALLET_PATH=~/myWallet.json $ export WEB3J_WALLET_PASSWORD=myStrongPassword Start the server \u00b6 Starting the server can be done in the following ways: The generated JAR \u00b6 A JAR can be generated using the following command: $ ./gradlew shadowJar It will be found under the build/libs directory. The generated JAR can be run using the following: $ java -jar build/libs/<project name>-all.jar <parameters> check the parameters section above for the supported parameters. The distribution executable \u00b6 A server executable can be generated using the following: $ ./gradlew installShadowDist <parameters> Which can be found in build/install/<app name>-shadow/bin/ Using gradle \u00b6 To run the project using gradle. Make sure to have set some environment variables or configuration file as specified above. Then, run the following : $ ./gradlew run The Web3j-OpenAPI client \u00b6 Among the available ways to interact with a Web3j-OpenAPI server, there is the Kotlin client. It is easy to use. Start by adding dependency to the client: dependencies { implementation \"org.web3j.openapi:web3j-openapi-client:4.8.7\" } Then, within a client application: val service = ClientService ( \"http://localhost:9090\" ) val app = ClientFactory . create ( < AppNameApi >:: class . java , service ) // Then you have access to all the API resources val receipt = app . contracts . contractName . deploy () println ( \"Deployment receipt: ${ receipt . contractAddress } \" ) // ... Handling events \u00b6 In web3j-OpenAPI, we handle events using Server-Sent Events SSE . In a nutshell, SSE is a one way mechanism that allows a server to asynchronously push data from the server to the client once the client-server connection is established by the client. To query events from Kotlin/Java . Add the web3j-openapi-client dependency as done above. Then, use the following code: val service = ClientService ( \"http://localhost:9090\" ) val app = ClientFactory . create ( AppNameApi :: class . java , service ) // Start listening for events val event = app . contracts . < contract_name > . load ( < contract_Address > ) . events . < event_name > . onEvent { println ( \"Received event: $ it \" ) } // Trigger an event app . contracts . < contract_name > . load ( < contract_Address > ) . < method_triggering_event > ( < method_parameters > ) Then run this code. You should be able to see events printing on the screen.","title":"Web3j OpenAPI"},{"location":"web3j_openapi/#web3j-openapi","text":"Web3j-OpenAPI is a OpenAPI client and server generator from Solidity smart contracts.

Usage in web3j \u00b6 You can use ENS names anywhere you wish to transact in web3j. In practice this means, in smart contract wrappers, when you load them, such as: YourSmartContract contract = YourSmartContract . load ( \"0x<address>|<ensName>\" , web3j , credentials , GAS_PRICE , GAS_LIMIT ); Also, when performing Ether transfers, such as using the command line tools: $ web3j wallet send <walletfile> 0x<address> | <ensName> web3j implementation \u00b6 Behind the scenes, whenever you using web3j's transaction managers (which are derived from the ManagedTransaction class), the EnsResolver is invoked to perform an ENS lookup if applicable.

There are three classes of filter supported in Ethereum: Block filters Pending transaction filters Topic filters Block filters and pending transaction filters provide notification of the creation of new transactions or blocks on the network. Topic filters are more flexible. These allow you to create a filter based on specific criteria that you provide. Unfortunately, unless you are using a WebSocket connection to Geth, working with filters via the JSON-RPC API is a tedious process, where you need to poll the Ethereum client in order to find out if there are any updates to your filters due to the synchronous nature of HTTP and IPC requests. Additionally the block and transaction filters only provide the transaction or block hash, so a further request is required to obtain the actual transaction or block referred to by the hash. web3j's managed Filter implementation address these issues, so you have a fully asynchronous event based API for working with filters. It uses RxJava 's Flowables which provides a consistent API for working with events, which facilitates the chaining together of JSON-RPC calls via functional composition. Note: filters are not supported on Infura. Block and transaction filters \u00b6 To receive all new blocks as they are added to the blockchain (the false parameter specifies that we only want the blocks, not the embedded transactions too): Subscription subscription = web3j . blockFlowable ( false ). subscribe ( block -> { ... }); To receive all new transactions as they are added to the blockchain: Subscription subscription = web3j . transactionFlowable (). subscribe ( tx -> { ... }); To receive all pending transactions as they are submitted to the network (i.e. before they have been grouped into a block together): Subscription subscription = web3j . pendingTransactionFlowable (). subscribe ( tx -> { ... }); Subscriptions should always be cancelled when no longer required via unsubscribe : subscription . unsubscribe (); Other callbacks are also provided which provide simply the block or transaction hashes, for details of these refer to the Web3jRx interface. Replay filters \u00b6 web3j also provides filters for replaying block and transaction history. To replay a range of blocks from the blockchain: Subscription subscription = web3j . replayBlocksFlowable ( < startBlockNumber > , < endBlockNumber > , < fullTxObjects > ) . subscribe ( block -> { ... }); To replay the individual transactions contained within a range of blocks: Subscription subscription = web3j . replayTransactionsFlowable ( < startBlockNumber > , < endBlockNumber > ) . subscribe ( tx -> { ... }); You can also get web3j to replay all blocks up to the most current, and provide notification (via the submitted Flowable) once you've caught up: Subscription subscription = web3j . replayPastBlocksFlowable ( < startBlockNumber > , < fullTxObjects > , < onCompleteFlowable > ) . subscribe ( block -> { ... }); Or, if you'd rather replay all blocks to the most current, then be notified of new subsequent blocks being created: Subscription subscription = web3j . replayPastAndFutureBlocksFlowable ( < startBlockNumber > , < fullTxObjects > ) . subscribe ( block -> { ... }); As above, but with transactions contained within blocks: Subscription subscription = web3j . replayPastAndFutureTransactionsFlowable ( < startBlockNumber > ) . subscribe ( tx -> { ... }); All of the above filters are exported via the Web3jRx interface. Topic filters and EVM events \u00b6 Topic filters capture details of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) events taking place in the network. These events are created by smart contracts and stored in the transaction log associated with a smart contract. The Solidity documentation provides a good overview of EVM events. You use the EthFilter type to specify the topics that you wish to apply to the filter. This can include the address of the smart contract you wish to apply the filter to. You can also provide specific topics to filter on. Where the individual topics represent indexed parameters on the smart contract: EthFilter filter = new EthFilter ( DefaultBlockParameterName . EARLIEST , DefaultBlockParameterName . LATEST , < contract - address > ) [ . addSingleTopic (...) | . addOptionalTopics (..., ...) | ... ] ; This filter can then be created using a similar syntax to the block and transaction filters above: web3j . ethLogFlowable ( filter ). subscribe ( log -> { ... }); The filter topics can only refer to the indexed Solidity event parameters. It is not possible to filter on the non-indexed event parameters. Additionally, for any indexed event parameters that are variable length array types such as string and bytes, the Keccak-256 hash of their value is stored on the EVM log. It is not possible to store or filter using their full value. If you create a filter instance with no topics associated with it, all EVM events taking place in the network will be captured by the filter. A note on functional composition \u00b6 In addition to send() and sendAsync , all JSON-RPC method implementations in web3j support the flowable() method to create a Flowable to execute the request asynchronously. This makes it very straight forwards to compose JSON-RPC calls together into new functions. For instance, the blockFlowable is itself composed of a number of separate JSON-RPC calls: public Flowable < EthBlock > blockFlowable ( boolean fullTransactionObjects , long pollingInterval ) { return this . ethBlockHashFlowable ( pollingInterval ) . flatMap ( blockHash -> web3j . ethGetBlockByHash ( blockHash , fullTransactionObjects ). flowable ()); } Here we first create a flowable that provides notifications of the block hash of each newly created block. We then use flatMap to invoke a call to ethGetBlockByHash to obtain the full block details which is what is passed to the subscriber of the flowable. Further examples \u00b6 Please refer to the integration test FlowableIT for further examples.

The default mechanism uses web3j's RawTransactionManager which works with Ethereum wallet files to sign transactions offline before submitting them to the network. However, you may wish to modify the transaction manager, which you can pass to the smart contract deployment and creation methods instead of a credentials object, i.e.: YourSmartContract contract = YourSmartContract . deploy ( < web3j > , < transactionManager > , GAS_PRICE , GAS_LIMIT , < param1 > , ..., < paramN > ). send (); In addition to the RawTransactionManager, web3j provides a ClientTransactionManager which passes the responsibility of signing your transaction on to the Ethereum client you are connecting to. There is also a ReadonlyTransactionManager for when you only want to retrieve data from a smart contract, but not transact with it. Specifying the Chain Id on Transactions (EIP-155) \u00b6 The RawTransactionManager takes an optional chainId parameter to specify the chain id to be used on transactions as per EIP-155 . This prevents transactions from one chain being re-broadcast onto another chain, such as from Ropsten to Mainnet: TransactionManager transactionManager = new RawTransactionManager ( web3j , credentials , ChainId . MAINNET ); In order to avoid having to change config or code to specify which chain you are working with, web3j's default behaviour is to not specify chain ids on transactions to simplify working with the library. However, the recommendation of the Ethereum community is to use them. You can obtain the chain id of the network that your Ethereum client is connected to with the following request: web3j . netVersion (). send (). getNetVersion (); Transaction Receipt Processors \u00b6 By default, when a new transaction is submitted by web3j to an Ethereum client, web3j will continually poll the client until it receives a TransactionReceipt , indicating that the transaction has been added to the blockchain. If you are sending a number of transactions asynchronously with web3j, this can result in a number of threads polling the client concurrently. To reduce this polling overhead, web3j provides configurable TransactionReceiptProcessors . There are a number of processors provided in web3j: PollingTransactionReceiptProcessor is the default processor used in web3j, which polls periodically for a transaction receipt for each individual pending transaction. QueuingTransactionReceiptProcessor has an internal queue of all pending transactions. It contains a worker that runs periodically to query if a transaction receipt is available yet. If a receipt is found, a callback to the client is invoked. NoOpProcessor provides an EmptyTransactionReceipt to clients which only contains the transaction hash. This is for clients who do not want web3j to perform any polling for a transaction receipt. Note: the EmptyTransactionReceipt is also provided in the the initial response from the QueuingTransactionReceiptProcessor . This allows the caller to have the transaction hash for the transaction that was submitted to the network. If you do not wish to use the default processor( PollingTransactionReceiptProcessor ), you can specify the transaction receipt processor to use as follows: TransactionReceiptProcessor transactionReceiptProcessor = new QueuingTransactionReceiptProcessor ( web3j , new Callback () { @Override public void accept ( TransactionReceipt transactionReceipt ) { // process transactionReceipt } @Override public void exception ( Exception exception ) { // handle exception } TransactionManager transactionManager = new RawTransactionManager ( web3j , credentials , ChainId . MAINNET , transactionReceiptProcessor ); If you require further information, the FastRawTransactionManagerIT demonstrates the polling and queuing approaches. Invoking transactions and events \u00b6 All transactional smart contract methods are named identically to their Solidity methods, taking the same parameter values. Transactional calls do not return any values, regardless of the return type specified on the method. Hence, for all transactional methods the Transaction Receipt associated with the transaction is returned.: TransactionReceipt transactionReceipt = contract . someMethod ( < param1 > , ...). send (); The transaction receipt is useful for two reasons: It provides details of the mined block that the transaction resides in Solidity events that are called will be logged as part of the transaction, which can then be extracted Any events defined within a smart contract will be represented in the smart contract wrapper with a method named process<Event Name>Event , which takes the Transaction Receipt and from this extracts the indexed and non-indexed event parameters, which are returned decoded in an instance of the EventValues object.: EventValues eventValues = contract . processSomeEvent ( transactionReceipt ); Alternatively you can use an Flowable filter instead which will listen for events associated with the smart contract: contract . someEventFlowable ( startBlock , endBlock ). . subscribe ( event -> ...); For more information on working with Flowable filters, refer to Filters and Events . Remember that for any indexed array, bytes and string Solidity parameter types, a Keccak-256 hash of their values will be returned, see the documentation for further information. Calling constant methods \u00b6 Constant methods are those that read a value in a smart contract, and do not alter the state of the smart contract. These methods are available with the same method signature as the smart contract they were generated from: Type result = contract . someMethod ( < param1 > , ...). send (); Dynamic gas price and limit \u00b6 When working with smart contracts you may want to specify different gas price and limit values depending on the function being invoked. You can do that by creating your own ContractGasProvider for the smart contract wrapper. Every generated wrapper contains all smart contract method names listed as a constants, which facilitates compilation-time matching via a switch statement. For example, using the Greeter contract: Greeter greeter = new Greeter (...); greeter . setGasProvider ( new DefaultGasProvider () { @Override public BigInteger getGasPrice ( String contractFunc ) { switch ( contractFunc ) { case Greeter . FUNC_GREET : return BigInteger . valueOf ( 22_000_000_000L ); case Greeter .
